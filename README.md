# Greet_ME_Using_Python

This is a Simple and Easy Python Program which will Greet you as soon as you run the code.

In this, we have used pyttsx3 which will simply listen and response based on the given commands.
This is Speech recognition program where by just saying the command 'date' and 'time' you will get to know the current date and time respectively.

This program will also greet you with salutation such good morning, afternoon or evening based on the current time and many more

I got a lot to learn from this program. Hope this will also help you to build further.
